# uses MSP430 microcontroller
# Can send wake up signal to probe when receives a wake up/start signal from machine controller
# receives a probe touch signal from probe, change state on output pin to take machine controller pin low through transistor
# receives low battery alert to change state on output pin to take machine controller pin low through transistor
# Status light on machine side that will light up when probe touches
